Extensible SOCKS tunnel / proxy server daemon written in PHP

## Features

The SOCKS protocol family can be used to easily tunnel TCP connections independent
of the actual application level protocol, such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, Telnet, etc.
In this mode, a SOCKS server acts as a generic proxy allowing higher level application protocols to work through it.

*   SOCKS proxy server with support for SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5 protocol versions (all at the same time)
*   Optionally require username / password authentication (SOCKS5 only)
*   Zero configuration, easy to use command line interface (CLI) to change settings without restarting server
*   Incoming SOCKS requests can be forwarded to another SOCKS server to act as a tunnel gateway,
perform transparent protocol translation or add SOCKS authentication for clients not capable of doing it themselves.
    *   Tunnel endpoint can be changed during runtime (`via` CLI command).
    *   Particularly useful when used as an intermediary server and using ever-changing public SOCKS tunnel end points.
*   Using an async event-loop, it is capable of handling multiple concurrent connections in a non-blocking fashion
*   Built upon the shoulders of [reactphp/react](https://github.com/reactphp/react) and
[clue/socks](https://github.com/clue/socks), it uses well-tested dependencies instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Usage

Once [installed](#install), you can start `psocksd` and listen for incoming SOCKS connections by running:

```bash
$ php psocksd.phar
```

Using this command, `psocksd` will start listening on the default adress `localhost:9050`.

### Listen address

If you want to listen on another address, you can supply an explicit
listen address like this:

```bash
# start SOCKS daemon on port 9051 instead
$ php psocksd.phar 9051

# explicitly listen on the given interface
$ php psocksd.phar 192.168.1.2:9050

# listen on all interfaces (allow access to SOCKS server from the outside)
$ php psocksd.phar *:9050

# explicitly only support SOCKS5 and reject other protocol versions
$ php psocksd.phar socks5://localhost:9050

# require client to send the given authentication information
$ php psocksd.phar socks5://username:password@localhost:9051
```

### Client configuration

Once `psocksd` is started, it accepts incoming SOCKS client connections.
Therefor, you have to configure your client program (webbrowser, email client etc.) to actually use the SOCKS server.

The exact configuration depends on your program, but quite a few programs allow you to use a SOCKS proxy.
So depending on the above list address, supply the following information:

```
Proxy-Type: SOCKS4 or SOCKS5
Socks-Host: localhost
Socks-Port: 9050
```

## Install

You can grab a copy of clue/psocksd in either of the following ways.

### As a phar (recommended)

You can simply download a pre-compiled and ready-to-use version as a Phar
to any directory:

```bash
$ wget http://www.lueck.tv/psocksd/psocksd.phar
```

> If you prefer a global (system-wide) installation without having to type the `.phar` extension
each time, you may invoke:
> 
> ```bash
> $ chmod 0755 psocksd.phar
> $ sudo mv psocksd.phar /usr/local/bin/psocksd
> ```
>
> You can verify everything works by running:
> 
> ```bash
> $ psocksd
> ```

#### Updating phar

There's no separate `update` procedure, simply overwrite the existing phar with the new version downloaded.

### Manual Installation from Source

The manual way to install `psocksd` is to clone (or download) this repository
and use [composer](http://getcomposer.org) to download its dependencies.
Obviously, for this to work, you'll need PHP, git and curl installed:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install php5-cli git curl
$ git clone https://github.com/clue/psocksd.git
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

> If you want to build the above mentioned `psocksd.phar` yourself, you have
to install [clue/phar-composer](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer#install)
and can simply invoke:
>
> ```bash
> $ php phar-composer.phar build ~/workspace/psocksd
> ```

#### Updating manually

If you have followed the above install instructions, you can update `psocksd` by issuing the following two commands:

```bash
$ git pull
$ php composer.phar install
```
